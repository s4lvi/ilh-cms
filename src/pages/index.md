  description: >-
    ILH was founded in 1998 by Ruth Shortie. She has been inspired by personal
    experience with her own son's struggles with learning disabilities. Shortie
    has made ILH her life's work. There are a great deal of statistics that show
    that the City of Detroit is having a crisis in the area of Special
    Education. With the help of volunteers and donations, ILH strives to make a
    difference in Detroit and the surrounding communities.


    The Independent Living Housing, Inc. (ILHI) would like to have a
    multi-apartment building donated to us. We would like to begin focusing on
    our main goal which is to be the best Behavior Health Provider in
    Southeastern Michigan. We would like to do this by providing services in
    family shelters throughout Southeastern Michigan for the Mentally Challenged
    with I.Q.'s of 50 and above. To acquire a building of 50 single rooms for
    single individuals who are not ready to be on their own and to offer
    behavior and transition services.
