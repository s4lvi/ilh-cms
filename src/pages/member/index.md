ruth: "I was so angry with the Detroit Public Schools and the Detroit and Wayne County Mental Health Services for not meeting my son Clifton's needs. I felt that I had to release the anger and stress of not being able to help my only child. I attempted to recruit other special need parents to form a board of directors; they were not interested. I kept on asking parents and people I would run into at the doctor’s office, town halls, and parent & teacher meetings at schools. When I met three people who felt the same way, then I contacted the Neighborhood Service Organization (NSO) Developmental Unit. The only thing that I knew was that I wanted to form an organization to serve the Developmentally Delayed students to provide with emotional and educational needs. The NSO filed the necessary paperwork for the organization, which is today known as Independent Living Housing, Inc. This organization responded to an unmet need of the community. It is tailored to help children and adults in the city of Detroit to be or have the opportunity to be productive citizens. 

I have over thirty years of experience advocating for my son and working with the Developmentally Delayed and Mentally ill population. I worked for 27 years in the A & P & Farmer Jack Supermarkets in the capacity of cashier, bookkeeper and manager. I bring to this organization a wealth of knowledge in customer services and the general public at large. I have two and half years of general studies and a certificate in mental health from the Wayne county community college"

The curriculum is a combination of ethnomathematics, motivational and professional ethics for results in excellent customer service. As a native Detroiter, Beverly fell in love with non-profits because her own life had been saved by one during the 70”s, when drugs, poverty and juvenile delinquency was critical. “They gave us incentives with trips, horseback riding in Canada, go cart riding, arts and crafts with a goody store onsite. They did this to encourage our interest in school and life. They provided us with the  tools for positive self-esteem and motivation” Beverly recalls gratefully. In 2013, she became an Ordained Inner Healing Minister, who after receiving instructional Inner Healing therapy since 2005 felt inspired to help the learning disabled/mentally challenged change the way they see themselves thus changing the world’s opinion of these unique people forever."
