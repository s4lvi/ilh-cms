title: About Us
description: Independent Living Housing, Inc. (ILH) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established for the charitable purpose of providing life skills and educational services to developmentally challenged youth and those youth and young adults in metro Detroit who are lagging behind in their classes. ILHI has been in existence since 1998 and has positively impacted the lives of many of youth and young adults. ILH responded to an unmet need by the School district and the community at large.
disability: LD’s are Neurologically-based problems. They can’t be cured or fixed. They are a lifelong challenge. Learning disabilities (LD‘s) affect the brains ability to receive, process, store, respond to, and communicate information. Once thought of as a single disorder, LD’s are actually groups of disorders. These effects can limit one’s ability to reason, write, speak, spell, perform mathematical calculations and can hinder an individual’s attention span, coordination, social skills, and emotional maturity. Learning disabilities also interfere with higher level skills such as organization, time management, abstract reasoning, and both long and short term memory. It is important to realize that learning disabilities can impact an individual’s life beyond academics  and can strain relationships with family, friends, and coworkers.
mission: The mission of Independent Living Housing, Inc. is to provide independent living programs for youth and young adults who have learning disabilities and who are socially as well as economically disadvantaged, group homes and safe, decent and affordable housing.
vision: ILH's vision is to create an environment where the learning disabled can reach their maximum potential and become productive citizens.
program: ILH developed the "Today's Youth" program to enhance the self-esteem and teach life skills to children and young adults who are learning-disabled and developmentally challenged. Youth with learning disabilities can lead enriched lives when they are in an environment that builds their self-confidence, leadership and other life skills. The self-esteem workshops and after-school tutorials are designed to help youth build positive self-esteem; identify emotional spirals; understand and apply effective conflict resolution; improve their proficiency in reading, writing, math, science, computer and study skills; and prepare them for reading and MEAP testing.
target: Our target population is the learning disabled and other at-risk youth and young adults ages 3-26 who are assigned to the Specialized Student Services Departments at Winship Elementary/Middle, Cervency Middle, Post, Barbara Jordan, Central High, Coffee, Cooley High, Rutherford, and Bethune schools; and/or the general public.
