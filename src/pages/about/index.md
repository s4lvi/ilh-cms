Independent Living Housing, Inc. (ILH) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established for the charitable purpose of providing life skills and educational services to developmentally challenged youth and those youth and young adults in metro Detroit who are lagging behind in their classes. ILHI has been in existence since 1998 and has positively impacted the lives of many of youth and young adults. ILH responded to an unmet need by the School district and the community at large.

## OUR MISSION

The mission of Independent Living Housing, Inc. is to provide independent living programs for youth and young adults who have learning disabilities and who are socially as well as economically disadvantaged, group homes and safe, decent and affordable housing.\
.

## OUR VISION

ILH's vision is to create an environment where the learning disabled can reach their maximum potential and become productive citizens.

## OUR PROGRAM

ILH developed the "Today's Youth" program to enhance the self-esteem and teach life skills to children and young adults who are learning-disabled and developmentally challenged. Youth with learning disabilities can lead enriched lives when they are in an environment that builds their self-confidence, leadership and other life skills. The self-esteem workshops and after-school tutorials are designed to help youth build positive self-esteem; identify emotional spirals; understand and apply effective conflict resolution; improve their proficiency in reading, writing, math, science, computer and study skills; and prepare them for reading and MEAP testing.

## TARGET POPULATION

Learning disabled and other at-risks youth and young adults ages 3-26 who are assigned to the Specialized Student Services Departments at Winship Elementary/Middle, Cervency Middle, Post, Barbara Jordan, Central High, Coffee, Cooley High, Rutherford, and Bethune schools; and/or the general public.

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Since 2001, ILH has partnered with several Detroit public schools to implement the Today's Youth program. Below is a summary of the activities carried out within the Detroit Public School system.
